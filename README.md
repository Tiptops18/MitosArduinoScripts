# ArduinoScripts
This is a common repo for different small arduino projects. They weren't really worth sepearate repos themselves, so I've conglomerated them here. If any one of them becomes large enough however, I'll remove it, make a new repo for it, and add a link here.

Projects List
1. Zelda Song Player- This folder contains a header file for the pitches used in the main .ino file. It is meant to be used
with the DFRobot Input Shield for Arduino Uno and a Gravity interface Speaker in the 2nd ICSP connection. 

2. Temperature Index Trigger- This code is used in both SCARF and Liquid Cooling Device, simply change the threshold for
activation and it can be used in either one.
